# Instances for the Crossing Postman Problem with Neighborhoods (XPPN)

This repository contains models of the Crossing Postman Problem with Neighborhoods (XPPN). These models are saved in .lp format, ready to be optimized in some on-the-shelf solver (Gurobi, Cplex, Xpress).

There are three different folders related to the model that is implemented:

- **MTZ**: XPPN formulation based on the Miller Tucker Zemlin inequalities.
- **SEC**: XPPN based on Subtour Elimination Constraints.
- **Symmetric SEC**: XPPN based on Subtour Elimination Constraints that takes into account the symmetry of the problem.

For each folder, there exists 416 different problems generated by using different configurations of the parameters. The format of each file is _model-n-r-mode.lp_ where:
- model= MTZ / SEC / sSEC
- n = number of neighborhoods: n in {5, ..., 30}.
- r = radii of neighborhoods: r in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
- mode = nature of neighborhoods: mode in {1, 2, 3, 4}.
